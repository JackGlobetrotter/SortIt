# SortIt! - A Fabric Item Sorting Mod

Attention!! This mod is currently a pre-release version!! Try it at your own risk. Stuff is bound to break, and things might and will change.

This mod tries to alleviate the vanilla problem of having to build somewhat large item-sorter contraptions which can be quite resource-heavy, large and complicated to get working correctly (especially if you want to have a nice and large sorting/storage system).
It adds some blocks for item sorting/filtering while maintaining a vanilla-like gameplay. These sorters are somewhat expensive, especially the multi-item-sorters, as they are intended to be mid/late-game content.

More information to come later on.
