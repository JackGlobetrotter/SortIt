# SortIt! - A Fabric Item Sorting Mod
 
This mod tries to alleviate having to build large item-sorter constructions which can be quiet resource-heavy.
It adds some blocks for item sorting/filtering while maintaining a vanilla-like gameplay.
The sorters are somewhat expensive, especially the multi-sorters, as they are intended to be mid/late-game content. 

## Setup

 - Add the .zip release to your Mod folder
 - Run the game


## Build

 - `./gradlew init`
 - `./gradlew build`
